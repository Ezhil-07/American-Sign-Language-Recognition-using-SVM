# American-Sign-Language-Recognition-using-SVM
The goal of the specialized machine learning repository American Sign Language Predict is to develop accurate and resource-efficient models for predicting signs and gestures in American Sign Language (ASL). Its main objective is to reduce the gap in communication between the hearing and Deaf communities by utilizing state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning and computer vision. By doing this, ASL-Predict hopes to make interactions between those who use ASL and those who do not more seamless and inclusive.
# Usage
**Dataset preparation:** Start by creating or acquiring a dataset of moves and signs used in American Sign Language in the form of images or video frames. The appropriate ASL symbols need to be identified on this dataset.\
**Preprocessing the data:** Make sure the dataset is consistent and high-quality. This could entail doing things like cropping photos, turning them into grayscale, or using filters to bring out specific details.\
**Feature Extraction:** From the previously processed photos or video frames, extract the pertinent elements. Typical methods include edge detection, color histogram extraction, and deep learning models for automatic feature extraction.\
**Training the SVM Model:** Using the characteristics that were retrieved, train a classification model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique. To do this, divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Next, use the training data to train the SVM model.\
**Model Evaluation:** Using the testing dataset, evaluate the trained SVM model to determine how well it performs and how accurate it is in identifying ASL moves and signs. This stage aids in detecting any problems or potential areas for development.\
**Testing and Deployment:** The model can be tested on fresh, untested data to confirm its functionality in actual situations after it has been trained and approved by evaluation. Lastly, the trained model can be implemented for real-world applications, including systems or applications for ASL recognition.\
**Fine-tuning and Optimization:** To increase the SVM model's accuracy and resilience, make constant improvements to its parameters, investigate various feature extraction strategies, and include new data.
